# Do not use the internet.  If you forget a particular ruby method, write it yourself.

# Look at the test cases below the problem before you approach it.
# Use the debugger when code doesn't run how you expect.

# Word With Most Repeats
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given a sentence, find which word has the greatest amount of repeated letters.
#
# For example, "I took the road less traveled and that has made all the difference"
# should return "difference" because it has two repeated letters (f and e).
#
# All words will be separated by spaces and there will be no punctuation or
# capitalization.  If there is a tie return the first word

	  def letters_hash(string)
	count = Hash.new 0
	letters = string.split("")
	
	
	letters.each do |i|
		count[i] += 1
	end
	largest = count.max_by { |k,v| v}
	largest[1]
end

def word_with_most_repeats(sentence)
	  
	  words = sentence.split(" ")
	  counter = []
	  most_repeats = 0
	  index_of_most = 0
	  #split sentence into "words"
	    
	   words.each do |i|
	   	counter << letters_hash(i)
	   end
     
     i = 0
     
    while i < counter.length
     
      if counter[i] > most_repeats
       	most_repeats = counter[i]
     	  index_of_most = i
      end
      
      i += 1
    end

# Even Splitters
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Return an array of characters on which we can split an input string to produce
# substrings of the same length.

# Don't count empty strings after the split.

# Here's an example for "banana":
#
# "banana".split("a") # => ["b", "n", "n"] (all elements same length)
# "banana".split("b") # => ["", anana"] (all elements same length - there's only
# one element "anana" because the empty string doesn't count)
# "banana".split("n") # => ["ba", "a", "a"] (all elements NOT same length)
#
# result: ["b", "a"]
#

# Isogram Matcher
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An isogram is a word with only unique, non-repeating letters. Given two isograms
# of the same length, return an array with two numbers indicating matches:

# and the second is the number of letters matched in both words but not in the
# same position.

# Xbonacci
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Write a Xbonacci function that works similarly to the fibonacci sequence.
# The fibonacci sequence takes the last two numbers in the sequence and adds
# them together to create the next number.
#
# First five fibonacci numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# The fourth fibonacci number (3) is the sum of the two numbers before it
# (1 and 2).
#
# In Xbonacci, the sum of the last X numbers (instead of the last 2 numbers)
# of the sequence becomes the next number in the sequence.
#
# The method will take two inputs: the starting sequence with X number of
# elements and an integer N, and return the first N elements in the given
# sequence.  Take a look at the test cases for examples.
#
# In the code, how_many_numbers_to_sum is the same as X (name your variables
# descriptively!).
#
# In the code, number_of_fibonacci_numbers_to_return is the same as N.

def xbonacci(starting_sequence, number_of_fibonacci_numbers_to_return)
  # how_many_numbers_to_sum = starting_sequence.length

  #
  # your code goes here
  #
